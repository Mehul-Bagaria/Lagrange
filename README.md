## Optmisation methods

This repo will contains the brief introduction to Optmisation methods along with some solved examples using various Python libraries.

### Optmisation method
Optmisation is the process of finding the best result of a particular problem. Optmisation methods are all those methods that are utilised to find the optimal/best result for that problem.
#### Optmisation method types
Optmisation methods can generally be classified into two types based on the constraint it is subjected to -
1. **Optmisation with no constraints** - These types of methods deals with problem having the objective fucntion only, which has to be optimised either to gets its maximum value or minimum value.
2. **Optimisation with constraints** -These types of methods deals with the problems having objective function which is subjected to certain boundation or constraints to get the optmial value in those set of conditions.

Any optimization can be bounded or unbounded, bounded are those problems in which input (design) variables are restricted in a certain range.
Bounds differ from the constraints in the fact that, bounds acts on the input variables only, whereas constraints acts on the optimization function.  
_Both types of optmisation methods have been shown with solved examples in python._
