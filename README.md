## Optmisation methods

This repo will contains the brief introduction to Optmisation methods along with some solved examples using python.

### Optmisation method
Optmisation is the process of finding the best result of a particular problem. Optmisation methods are all those methods that are utilised to find the optimal/best result for that problem.
#### Optmisation method types
Optmisation methods can generally be classified into two types based on the boundations of the problem -
1. **Optmisation with no constraints** - These types of methods deals with problem having the objective fucntion only, which has to be optimised either to gets its maximum value or minimum value.
2. **Optimisation with constraints** -These types of methods deals with the problems having objective function which is subjected to certain boundation or constraints to get the optmial value in those set of conditions.

_Both types of optmisation methods have been shown with solved examples in python._
